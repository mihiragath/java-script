java script execution context

    =>{} is called globle execution context / function execution context / evaluation execution context
    =>{} called memory creation phase or execution phase.
    1. globle execution:-
        allocate on this function, it is necessary.
    2.memory phase:-
        store all variable with undefined value.
    3.execution phase:-
        store value on variable.
        when calling function then it will create an box then store [new variable enviroment + execution thread(arithmatic operation)]
            [i]memory phase:-
                ex- val1 = undefined, val2 = undefined

|----------->[ii]execution context:-
| allocate all value on variable then execute all process and perform some operation
| after execution execution created block which will create on function calling it will deleted
|
-- if any variable calling an function then recreate a box then store [new variable enviroment + execution thread(arithmatic operation)]
then repeate execution context.
